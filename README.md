Hey Aitra people,
all code is written by me and I use canva for design pattern and for icons stuff i used font awesome
In my project i have writen whole css react component from scratch 
in minimal time if i got more time then, i would write some more efficent styles and
refactor the code and naming convention for making the code managebale and much more crystal clear

I divided site dashboar into three subpart called

1.left pane(LeftPane.js)       2. main (Main.js)        3.Widget View "right part" (WidgetView.js)


all these three containing there respective component
