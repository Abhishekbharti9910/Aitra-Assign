Hey Aitra people,
all code is written by me and I use canva for design pattern and for icons stuff i used font awesome
In my project i have writen whole css react component from scratch 
in minimal time if i got more time then, i would write some more efficent styles and
refactor the code and naming convention for making the code managebale and much more crystal clear
